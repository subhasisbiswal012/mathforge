## ➕ Adding a New Topic

The entire app is data-driven. Adding a topic = adding one object. Zero UI changes needed.

### Step 1 — Add to `js/topics.js`

```js
TOPICS.push({
  id:    'trig',
  label: 'Trigonometry',
  icon:  '∠',
  color: '#5B21B6',
  desc:  'sin, cos, tan of standard angles.',
  count: 15,

  generate() {
    const pool = [
      { angle: 30, fn: 'sin', ans: '0.5'   },
      { angle: 45, fn: 'cos', ans: '0.707' },
      { angle: 60, fn: 'tan', ans: '1.732' },
      // add more rows…
    ];
    const q = pick(pool);
    return {
      question:   `<span class="math">${q.fn}(${q.angle}°)</span> = ?`,
      answer:     q.ans,
      type:       'input',       // 'input' or 'mcq'
      topic:      this.id,
      topicLabel: this.label,
      hint:       `${q.fn}(${q.angle}°) = ${q.ans}`,
    };
  },
});
```

### Step 2 — Add notes to `js/learn.js`

```js
LEARN_TOPICS.push({
  id:    'trig',
  label: 'Trigonometry',
  icon:  '∠',
  color: '#5B21B6',
  desc:  'sin, cos, tan reference table.',

  buildContent() {
    return `
      <div class="notes-section">
        <h3>Standard Angles</h3>
        ${makeTable(
          ['Angle', 'sin', 'cos', 'tan'],
          [
            ['0°',  '0',     '1',     '0'],
            ['30°', '0.5',   '0.866', '0.577'],
            ['45°', '0.707', '0.707', '1'],
            ['60°', '0.866', '0.5',   '1.732'],
            ['90°', '1',     '0',     '∞'],
          ]
        )}
      </div>`;
  },
});
```

**That's it.** Both the Practice and Learn sections pick it up automatically — no other file needs to change.

## 🔊 Adding Meme Sounds

Drop MP3 files into the `sounds/` folder with these exact filenames:

| File | Plays when |
|------|-----------|
| `perfect.mp3`   | Score = 100% |
| `excellent.mp3` | Score 95–99% |
| `good.mp3`      | Score 90–94% |
| `okay.mp3`      | Score 85–89% |
| `meh.mp3`       | Score 80–84% |
| `bad_1.mp3`     | Score below 80% (random pick) |
| `bad_2.mp3`     | Score below 80% |
| `bad_3.mp3`     | Score below 80% |
| `bad_4.mp3`     | Score below 80% |

The sound plays **3 times automatically** when results load. There's also a **"🔊 Your Review Sound"** button to replay it manually.

See `sounds/README.md` for more details and where to find free sounds.
